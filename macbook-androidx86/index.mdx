# MacBook Pro 2011 15" Android x86 fixes

## Before Installation

Force ALWAYS use Intel integrated GPU (EFI variable fix) otherwise it won't boot

Boot with Command + S run this command

```
nvram fa4ce28d-b62f-4c99-9cc3-6815686e30f9:gpu-power-prefs=%01%00%00%00
```

## After Installation

Install Android x86 with System root access and install SuperSU 2.79 and Root Explorer

### Wifi FIX

This model uses Broadcom B43xx chipset. It won't work newer kernels and Android Roms. Wifi is slower compared to MacOS and Linux. ie. my connection is of 35 MBps. I get approximately 18 MBps.

Mount EFI Partition with MacOS or live boot OS and change this grub boot entry in `efi/boot/android.cfg`

```js
add_entry "$live" quiet EXTMOD=b43
```

If Wifi is Missing after sleep, try Flight Mode. It will refresh UI and wifi appears again

### Brightness FIX ([thxMontajd](https://www.reddit.com/r/Androidx86/comments/8ms5ab/comment/dzqg4i9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3/) from Reddit)

Add these lines in `/system/build.prop`

```js
backlight.brightness_file=/sys/class/backlight/gmux_backlight/brightness
backlight.max_brightness_file=/sys/class/backlight/gmux_backlight/max_brightness
```

---

### Keyboard Backlights FIX

There is no brightness setting for keyboard leds on Android but It can be activated by entering a fixed backlight brightness value.

Add these lines in `/etc/init.sh`

```js
function init_hal_lights() // or It can be created new function init
{
    // current paramater //  chown 1000.1000....

    // min 0 - max 255
    echo 125 > /sys/class/leds/smc\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness

    // Disable Intel Turbo boost (Optional)
    echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
}
```

### Taskbar App FIX

Current Taskbar app keeps crashing on Androidx86 9.0 r2. Download [latest version](https://github.com/farmerbb/Taskbar/releases) of app and replace in
`/system/priv-app/Taskbar/Taskbar.apk`

### Not Working / Broken
